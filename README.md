# What is React?             

React.js, or simply React, is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UIs). It simplifies UI development by allowing developers to create reusable components that efficiently update and render as data changes.

# Core Concepts

1. Components: These are the building blocks of your React application. Imagine them like Lego bricks for your web page.
   Each component can represent a small, reusable part of the UI, like a button, a menu, or a form.
   They can be either class-based or function-based (functional components).

   &bull; Class Components: The traditional way of creating components is using ES6 classes.
   
   &bull; Functional Components: A simpler way to create components using functions. They can use hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.

3. JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.
   React components typically use JSX to describe what the UI should look like.

4. Props: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the receiving component.

5. State: State is used to manage data that changes over time within a component. Unlike props, state is managed within the component and can be updated using the setState method (in class components) or the useState hook (in functional components).

6. Lifecycle Methods: Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).

7. Hooks: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks are useState and useEffect.

# Before React

### JavaScript Fundamentals:

• Variables, Data Types, and Operators: Understand how to store and manipulate data using variables, different data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.), and operators (+, -, *, /, etc.).

• Functions: Grasp how to create reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

• Control Flow (Conditionals and Loops): Learn how to control the flow of your program using conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for, while) to make decisions and repeat actions.

• Arrays and Objects: Understand how to work with structured data using arrays (ordered lists) and objects (collections of key-value pairs).

• DOM Manipulation: Get comfortable with how JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the content and structure of your web pages.

#### Modern JavaScript (ES6+):

• Be familiar with the features introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later versions. This includes concepts like arrow functions, classes, template literals, and promises, which are commonly used in React development.

### Optional but Helpful:
• HTML and CSS: While not strictly required, having a basic understanding of HTML and CSS will be beneficial as React builds user interfaces and utilizes JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML).
