# What is React?  

React.js, or simply React, is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UIs). It simplifies UI development by allowing developers to create reusable components that efficiently update and render as data changes.

# Core Concepts of React

1. Components: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either class-based or function-based (functional components).

   > &bull; Class Components: The traditional way of creating components is using ES6 classes.
   > 
   > &bull; Functional Components: A simpler way to create components using functions. They can use hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.

2. JSX: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.
   React components typically use JSX to describe what the UI should look like.

3. Props: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the receiving component.

4. State: State is used to manage data that changes over time within a component. Unlike props, state is managed within the component and can be updated using the setState method (in class components) or the useState hook (in functional components).

5. Lifecycle Methods: Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's lifecycle (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).

6. Hooks: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks are useState and useEffect.
